## SVG Guidelines

If your contribution involves SVG files, follow the technical constraints documented in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md):

- Do not use: `clipPath`, `mask`, `<style>`, `class`, external CSS, `<foreignObject>`, `<animate*>`, `<script>`, `<symbol>+<use>`
- Use `fill-opacity` / `stroke-opacity` instead of `rgba()`
- `marker-start` / `marker-end` are conditionally allowed — see `shared-standards.md` §1.1 for the constraints (must live in `<defs>`, `orient="auto"`, shape must be triangle / diamond / oval)
- All SVGs must use the correct `viewBox` for the target canvas format

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master/issues) and include:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Python version, AI editor used)
